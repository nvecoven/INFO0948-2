# Coppelia edu download and install

First, download the "Coppelia Edu" version on the following link : https://coppeliarobotics.com/downloads.html

Once downloaded, unpack the archive and install it in your folder of choice.
 If your firewall asks you whether Coppelia should be allowed, 
 always answer yes: the communication between Python and 
 Cppelia will take place via the network (internal to your computer). Otherwise, you will face problems later on.
