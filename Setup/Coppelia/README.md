# CoppeliaSim Edu download and install

First, download the latest version of [CoppeliaSim Edu](https://www.coppeliarobotics.com/downloads).

Once downloaded, unpack the archive and install it in your folder of choice.

If your firewall asks you whether CoppeliaSim should be allowed, always answer yes: the communication between CoppeliaSim and MATLAB or Python  will take place via the network (internal to your computer). Otherwise, you will face problems later on.

Once done, you can proceed to linking [Coppelia with your language of chioice](https://github.com/nvecoven/robotic_rework/tree/main/Setup).
