# 2020-2021 Project

Pour avoir une idée ....

## Goal

The goal is to blablabla ....

The main scene you will be working on is the "HOUSE" scene. You can find it in

```bash
~/trs/Setup/Coppelia/Scenes/House
```

In that folder, you will also find the appropriate instructions files needed for the objects placement
(in matlab and python format).

The robot you will use for this project is the youbot. All the scripts for language "YYY" relative to this bot are given in

```bash
~/trs/Setup/YYY/Youbot
```
